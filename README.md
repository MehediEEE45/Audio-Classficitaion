# Audio Classification and Speaker Identification System

This repository provides a comprehensive solution for audio classification and speaker identification, leveraging the UrbanSound8K dataset. The primary goal is to accurately classify various urban sound events—such as dog barks, car horns, and drilling—using advanced machine learning techniques. Additionally, the system is adaptable for speaker identification tasks.

## Key Features

- **Audio Preprocessing**: Efficient handling of raw audio files, including normalization, resampling, and noise reduction.
- **Feature Extraction**: Utilizes Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) for robust audio feature representation.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Implements classical and deep learning models for sound classification and speaker identification.
- **Flexible Workflow**: Modular codebase designed for easy experimentation and extension to embedded systems or real-time applications.
- **Speaker Identification**: Framework can be adapted to recognize and differentiate speakers based on audio input.

## Workflow

1. **Preprocessing**: Clean and standardize audio samples.
2. **Feature Extraction**: Calculate MFCCs and other audio features.
3. **Model Training**: Train machine learning models for classification.
4. **Evaluation & Deployment**: Assess model performance and deploy on target platforms.

## Applications

- Urban sound event detection
- Speaker identification and verification
- Smart city monitoring
- Embedded and edge-computing solutions

Feel free to explore the code, contribute, or adapt the system to your specific audio analysis needs!
